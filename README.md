# Generate historic Dutch city names

I run a D&D campaign inspired by Dutch history, and I'm often in need of names for people and places. With this generator, I'm trying out the idea of procedurally generating city names.

I'm not yet sure what kind of algorithm I want to use. I will use a Markov Chain as a baseline algorithm, but I'm interested in trying out a neural network as well.

As positive examples, I use a selection of Dutch and Belgian city names that I copied from the _Atlas Nouveau des Dix-sept Provinces des Pais-Bas_ by Pierre Mortier, published around 1700.
